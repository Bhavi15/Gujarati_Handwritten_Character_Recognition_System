# Gujarati_Handwritten_Character_Recognition_System
Created a web app for recognizing Gujarati handwritten characters with Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Flask. Collected and processed a dataset of 31,735 images of 446 Gujarati characters and digits 0-9. Achieved 93.40% accuracy with a CNN model, integrated into the site using Flask.

## Objectives
1. Collect and preprocess a dataset of handwritten Gujarati characters.
2. Select and train an appropriate machine learning model for character recognition.
3. Test the model and integrate it into a web application.
4. Ensure the application accurately recognizes and converts handwritten Gujarati characters to readable text.

## Scope
The website allows users to input handwritten Gujarati characters and receive readable text in return. The system is designed to recognize characters with an accuracy of 93.40%. Note that recognition accuracy depends on the quality of the input image; higher quality images result in better recognition performance.

## Modules
Image Preprocessing: Preparing and cleaning images for feature extraction.
Feature Extraction: Identifying key features from the images for the CNN model.
Creating CNN Module: Designing and implementing the Convolutional Neural Network.
Training and Testing: Training the CNN model on the dataset and evaluating its performance.
Classification and Recognition: Applying the trained model to recognize and classify handwritten characters.

## Requirements
RAM: 6 GB or 12 GB
Text Editor/IDE: Any preferred text editor or IDE for website development
Libraries: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas
Programming Language: Python 3.9
IDE: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
Framework: Python Flask for web application integration
